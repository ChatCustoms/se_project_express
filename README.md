# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
In this back-end project for Sprint 12 I am creating a server for the WTWR application. This project uses express.js, and Postman application along with mongoDB and Compass application for testing the server.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
